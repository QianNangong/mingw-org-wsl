 * This file implements a POSIX.1-2008 conforming strnlen() function, under
 * the alternative public name of __mingw_strnlen(), (to avoid any possible
 * conflict with Microsoft's DLL implementations, or a replacement function
 * implemented by the user).
 *
 * Note that POSIX does not prescribe any error returns for its strnlen()
 * function; in particular, it does not specify handling of a NULL pointer,
 * passed as the string argument to count, and thus, a segmentation fault
 * is a plausible outcome.  This is consistent with the behaviour exhibited
 * by Microsoft's implementation, and this implementation acts likewise.
 *
 * OTOH, ISO-C11 TR-24731-1 prescribes that strnlen_s() shall return zero,
 * when passed a NULL pointer as the string argument; the alternative entry
 * point, __mingw_strnlen_s(), checks for this anomaly, and acts accordingly,
 * before continuing as for __mingw_strnlen(), when passed a valid pointer
 * to a string argument; (this is consistent with the documented behaviour
 * of Microsoft's strnlen_s() implementation).
 *
 * Note that I've chosen to implement this in assembly language to enable
 * sharing of common code between two distinct entry points, with subtly
 * differing behaviours, while avoiding the overhead of an extra function
 * call to invoke such shared code; this also allows the code to exploit
 * the CPU's string scanning instructions, (which GCC does not), and so
 * achieves a more compact, (and likely more efficient), implementation.
