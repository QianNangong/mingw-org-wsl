     * We may note that, in spite of our efforts to avoid overflow in the

     * point values, even when the ultimate result is both representable and

     * approaching an asymptotic minimum of 1.0, as z becomes vanishingly
     * small, while h becomes approximately equal to z as z becomes very
     * large; thus we may transform the expression to:
     *
     *   arsinh( z ) = log( z / h + 1.0 ) + log( h )

     *
     * which is computable, without overflow, for all finite values of z
     * with corresponding finite values of h for which the logarithm is
     * computable.

     * Finally, we note that the ultimate result has the same sign as the
     * original value of x, with magnitude as computed by the preceding
     * expression; thus...
