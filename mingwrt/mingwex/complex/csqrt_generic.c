  /* Now, we may recompute the value of Z, such that it will become
   * the principal square root of x + iy; let's call it a + ib.  Thus,
   * in the general case, we may state that:
   *
   *   (a + ib) * (a + ib) = x + iy			(1)
   *
   * which may be expanded to:
   *
   *   a^2 + i^2 * b^2 + 2 * a * b * i = x + iy 	(2)
   *
   * or, since i^2 == -1, (by definition):
   *
   *   a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = x + iy			(3)
   *
   * Comparing real and imaginary parts of LHS and RHS, we may
   * deduce the following pair of simultaneous equations:
   *
   *   a^2 - b^2 = x					(4)
   *   2ab = y						(5)
   *
   * Rearranging (5), and substituting to eliminate b from (4),
   * we deduce that:
   *
   *   a^2 - (y / 2a)^2 = x				(6)
   *
   * or, expanding and rearranging:
   *
   *   4a^2 * a^2 - 4a^2 * x = y^2			(7)
   *
   * which, since x and y are known, is quadratic in a^2:
   *
   *   (a^2)^2 - x * a^2 = y^2 / 4			(8)
   *
   * Completing the square on the LHS, and adjusting the RHS to
   * preserve equality:
   *
   *   (a^2)^2 - x * a^2 + x^2 / 4 = y^2 / 4 + x^2 / 4	(9)
   *
   * Factorizing, and solving for a^2:
   *
   *   (a^2 - x / 2)^2 = (y^2 + x^2) / 4	       (10)
   *
   * hence:
   *
   *   a^2 = sqrt(y^2 + x^2) / 2 + x / 2	       (11)
   *
   * and further, taking the principal (positive) square root yields the
   * general expression for the real part of the complex square root:
   *
   *   a = sqrt((sqrt(y^2 + x^2) + x) / 2)	       (12)
   *
   * Having calculated this real part, we may back-substitute into (5),
   * rearranged to yield the imaginary part:
   *
   *   b = y / (2 * a)				       (13)
