# This is also a convenient place to specify the import library
# associations, and DLLVERSION information for each DLL which may
# be delivered by this package; each specification record takes
# the form of three data fields, comprising:
#
# 1) A tag field, which maps the assignment to a makefile variable
#    substitution reference of the form @MAP_[TAG]_A_DLLVERSION@.
#
# 2) The name of the import library associated with the mapping.
#
# 3) The DLLVERSION for the corresponding DLL; this must be in the
#    libtool current:revision:age notation, and should be updated,
#    as required, in accordance with libtool conventions.
